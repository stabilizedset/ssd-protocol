## audit of forked codebase

is available [here](https://github.com/https://github.com/stabilizedset/ssd-protocol/blob/master/audit/REP-Dollar-06-11-20.pdf).

## disclaimer
this project is an experiment - the protocol is audited, and we've put a significant amount of work into testing as well as generally de-risking the design of its core mechanism, however participants should take great caution as bugs resulting in loss of funds are always a possibility.
